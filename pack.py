#by using this we have just imported the package 
#so for using the functions written inside the package we will have to use math.function_name
# import math 
# print(math.pi)


# By using this we have imported all the functions inside the math package 
# so for using any function we can directly write the function name
# from math import *
# print(pi)


# By using this we have just imported pi function from the math package
# so we cannot access any other package other than pi
# from math import pi 
# print(pi)
# print(factorial(6))
